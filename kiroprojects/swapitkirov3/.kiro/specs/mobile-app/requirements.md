# Mobile App Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SwapIt mobile application will be a React Native app built with Expo SDK 54 that provides a native mobile experience for the existing SwapIt web platform. The mobile app will share the same Supabase backend, ensuring data consistency and real-time synchronization between web and mobile platforms. The app will focus on mobile-first user experience with native features like camera integration, push notifications, location services, and offline capabilities.

**Design Implementation:** All mobile screens and components will be implemented based on provided Figma designs. The development process will use Figma MCP integration to extract design specifications, components, and assets directly from Figma files. No custom UI designs should be created - all visual elements must follow the provided Figma specifications exactly.
